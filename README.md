# Mastermind
This is a terminal version of the board game Mastermind.
It allows the player to play both as the codebreaker and the codebreaker.
Either making the code and watching the computer trying to guess it or trying to guess the code made by the computer.

This project is based on the Mastermind Assignment from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
